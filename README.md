# Beemer

This project attempts to use an HTTP interface for communicating with an IOC server. The IOC client and IOC server components use the [caproto](https://github.com/caproto/caproto) package. The HTTP components use the [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org) packages.
